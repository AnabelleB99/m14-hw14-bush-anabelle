# Project: Personal Webpage

## Bootstrap Components Used:
- Navbar: A responsive Bootstrap navbar is used at the top of the page. It collapses into a toggle menu on mobile screens and expands on larger screens.

- Cards: I used Bootstrap’s card component in the “Interests” section to feature an image and description of my cat, Delilah.

- Button: A Bootstrap button is placed in the “About” section as a call-to-action to view my portfolio.
